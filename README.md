# safesteps-frontend

### The goal of this project is to build a (React Native) mobile app that aims to improve safety for pedestrians crossing intersections at BU campus via receiving alerts when coming near the proximity of an integrated hardware sensor. Along with the ability for users to report accidents and obstacles when they are within an intersection to update other fellow pedestrians on any issues they might encounter when walking near the BU campus.

## To run the app locally:


## Install Dependencies

```shell
./setup.sh
```
## Start the App

```shell
npx expo start
```
